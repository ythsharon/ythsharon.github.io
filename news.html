			<h3 class="title-note">Investigating Opportune Moments for Pushed News Reading.</h3>
		  <br>
		  
		  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
		  <p>Pushed notifications from mobile news apps are an important means of access to news, but people do not always have sufficient time or cognitive resources to process them. Nevertheless, whether and to what extent news-reading behavior and performance are associated with particular moments of pushed-news delivery are understudied. We therefore built NewsMoment, a smartphone news-aggregation app that logs its users’ reading behavior and sends pushed news notifications for real news items from up to nine news organizations. Our ESM study found that pushed news was associated with two shallow reading modes – Scanning and Unengaged – which, though seemingly similar, were distinct in their prevalence, triggers, opportune moments, and self-assessed reading engagement and news items’ perceived credibility. We also found that opportune moments for reading entire articles were distinct from those for receiving notifications and checking news titles. These findings inform our pushed-news design recommendations aimed at reducing shallow reading.<br><br></p>
